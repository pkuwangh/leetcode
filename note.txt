P126: Word Ladder 2
    -- the high-level idea is to (1) find minimum length using BFS and (2) find all solutions using DFS/back-tracking.
    -- the BFS process is fast with a straightforward implementation because we can prune the word list along the way;
    -- during the DFS process, it will be super slow if we don't prune the word list;
    -- the key is to save the pruned word list for each level/step

P037: Sudoku Solver
    -- DFS; at each (row, col), find candidates based on rules

P041: First Missing Positive
    -- un-ordered array, normally need use a hash table
    -- with constant space, use the array itself as a constant space A[n] = n-1
